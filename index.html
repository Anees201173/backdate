    <p>
      Inn today’s world the power of data science is widely acknowledged, even in
      resource-rich settings and advanced countries.The prevailing consensus
      appreciates the power and potential of analytics and data science
      innovations. Imagine a starkly different situation in a country like
      Nigeria where the setting is resource-scarce and having access to
      healthcare is a challenge. Here, marginalised and highly vulnerable
      populations face even greater difficulties.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most powerful benefits of data science is its ability to save
      lives and transform healthcare access, particularly for underserved
      communities disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. This is especially
      true for marginalized key populations like LGBTQ+, female sex workers, and
      people who inject drugs. Few years ago when Data science was a budding
      industry, it became a veritable tool used to improve antiretroviral
      treatment adherence and outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, I had the opportunity to tap into data science’s potential by
      working as a volunteer on a PEPFAR-funded program through the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and implemented through Caritas
      Nigeria’s sponsored Community-Based Organization, Sisters Against HIV and
      Cancer Initiative (SACHI). This project involved building a data science
      model that could predict patient behavior and optimize HIV/AIDS treatment
      plans.
    </p>

    <h1>Primary Objective</h1>

    <p>
      Pioneering the use of analytics solutions among marginalized key
      populations living with HIV/AIDS in Delta State, Nigeria. The project
      aimed to develop a predictive model to ensure enhanced routine monitoring
      of patient adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) among key populations
      living with HIV/AIDS. By predicting patient behavior and treatment
      responses, the model aimed to optimize treatment management and outcomes,
      for the marginalized key populations like LGBTQ+, female sex workers, and
      people who inject drugs, in Delta State, Nigeria.
    </p>

    <h1>Technologies Used</h1>

    <p>• Python (used for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling).</p>

    <p>
      • Machine Learning Algorithms (used to find the most accurate predictive
      model while Random forests were effective).
    </p>

    <p>
      • Data visualization tools (used Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify
      critical insights).
    </p>

    <p>ART Intake Prediction</p>

    <p>
      The random forest model was found effective with 93% overall accuracy. The
      random forest classification report generated each trained model’s
      precision, recall, F1 score, and support proving its effectiveness. These
      outcomes can be viewed here. The following were the classes for which the
      model was trained for ART Intake prediction:
    </p>

    <p>• Class 0 – Majority Class (Active)</p>
    <p>• Class 1 – LTFU</p>
    <p>• Class 2 – Discontinued Care</p>
    <p>• Class 3 – Transferred Out</p>
    <p>• Class 4 – Death</p>

    <p>
      Some other features incorporated in the model include appointment status,
      biometric status, sex, current weight date, and more, all together 14 in
      number.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, by analyzing the patient reactions and identifying influential
      factors, this model provides insights into how patients respond to ART
      treatment. The following were the highlights.
    </p>

    <p>
      • There were variables with over 50% null values, which were eliminated to
      ensure model accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      • The analysis helped us understand the factors that affected ART
      adherence, patterns and correlations, patient behavior, and responses to
      treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
      • The model provided high precision and recall for the Majority Class
      (Active) but had some challenges predicting less common outcomes such as
      Discontinued Care and Transferred Out.
    </p>

    <p>
      • Identifying the key features that affect patient adherence helped
      provide actionable insights for healthcare providers and streamline
      personalized treatment plans.
    </p>

    <h1>Impact and Recognition</h1>

    <p>
      The model increased adherence rates by 27%, potentially leading to
      improved health outcomes for thousands of individuals, particularly among
      these marginalized key populations.The work was a textbook case of how
      data science can be harnessed to provide real life solutions with tangible
      impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our efforts were appreciated by various experts in the field of both data
      science and public health, including the following:
    </p>

    <p>
      • Charles Ogbonna, a seasoned health informatics and data expert currently
      serving as the Technical Advisor for Health Informatics at the US Military
      HIV Research Program, recognized the project’s significant impact on the
      program.
    </p>

    <p>
      • Dr. Courage Ekejiuba, a public health expert, and Victor Adamu, a public
      health expert on key populations with the CDC, also acknowledged the
      project’s contribution to improving HIV/AIDS treatment adherence.

    <p>
      The project’s success and impact, a direct testament to the power of data
      science, were pivotal in helping me and my team gaining recognition. Our
      efforts were rewarded by the CDC for outstanding contributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project served as an ideal showcase of expertise and knowledge of
      analytics, especially in a period when its application was more
      groundbreaking. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to work
      effectively across disciplines with colleagues, narrowing the gap between
      data science and real world impact.Although building a model was an
      integral component of the project it is important to understand that it’s
      true values lies in the ability to harness the potential of data science
      to create a real-world solution with tangible impact.
